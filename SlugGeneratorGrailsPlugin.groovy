This plugin generates unique slugs for String properties. Its main use case is to generate unique and "nice" URLs for accessing domain objects.

For example, instead of accessing a user profile by its id (http://www.domain.com/user/25) you can generate an unique URL based on the user's name: http://www.domain.com/user/ivan-lopez (in case the user name is Iv치n L칩pez).
